# 2D Metroidvania Platformer (In Development)

An action-oriented 2D platformer developed in **Unity 2D** using **C#**. This project focuses on building a scalable game architecture, robust physics-based character controllers, and an immersive exploration experience.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.x to 6000.2.12f1
* **Programming Language**: C#
* **Version Control**: Git / GitHub
* **Key Packages**: Cinemachine (Camera Tracking), Tilemap (Level Design), Input System

---

## 🚀 Current Technical Highlights
* **State-Driven Character Controller**: Implemented a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to manage complex player states (Idle, Run, Jump, Wall Slide, Dash, Attack), ensuring smooth transitions and responsive controls.
* **Modular Game Architecture**: Designed decoupled systems for health management, combat hitboxes, and environmental triggers to facilitate code maintainability and scalability.
* **Dynamic Camera System**: Leveraged **Cinemachine** with custom framing transposers and screen shake effects to enhance the "game feel" and player feedback.

## 🚧 Active Development & Roadmap
The project is currently in an active iteration phase. My current focus is on expanding the world-building and systemic depth:
- [ ] **Interactive Tutorial System**: Engineering a context-sensitive onboarding system that dynamically prompts players based on input history and environment triggers.
- [ ] **Level Design & World Building**: Crafting non-linear, interconnected zones with a focus on environmental storytelling and "ability-gating" progression.
- [ ] **Advanced AI Expansion**: Moving beyond basic patrol logic to implement behavior-based AI patterns, including varied attack telegraphs and proximity-based aggression.
